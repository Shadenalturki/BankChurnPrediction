# Bank Churn Prediction
## Project Overview
This project explores customer churn prediction in the banking industry using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains customer demographic details, transaction history, and account activity. Our goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the bank, enabling better customer retention strategies.

The study compares three models:

Logistic Regression (LR)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

## Key Features
• Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature selection.
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing customer churn trends and feature correlations.
• Machine Learning Models – Training Logistic Regression, SVM, and DNN for classification.
• Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimizing model performance using GridSearchCV and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
• Evaluation Metrics – Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for assessment.
• Comparison of Models – Highlighting strengths and weaknesses of different classifiers.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Features: 14 attributes including age, credit score, tenure, balance, product usage, and activity status.
Target: Exited (1) or Not Exited (0)
## Methodology
• Feature Selection – Removing irrelevant columns and selecting significant predictors.

• Data Transformation – One-hot encoding categorical variables (e.g., Geography, Gender).

• Model Training – Training LR, SVM, and DNN on an 80-20 train-test split.

• Hyperparameter Tuning – Using GridSearchCV and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve accuracy.

• Evaluation – Comparing models based on recall, precision, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, SVM)

TensorFlow & Keras (Deep Neural Networks)

Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
