# Bank Churn Prediction
## Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting customer churn in the banking industry** by analyzing customer data to determine **which customers are likely to leave and why**. By leveraging machine learning models, we identified key factors influencing churn, enabling banks to take proactive measures to improve customer retention strategies.

## Key Features
**Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** – Removing missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features.  
**Feature Selection** – Identifying the most significant attributes affecting customer churn.  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing trends in customer behavior and churn patterns.  
**Machine Learning Models** – Training and evaluating:

• Logistic Regression (LR)

• Support Vector Machine (SVM)

• Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

• 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

**Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimizing models using **GridSearchCV** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.  
**Evaluation Metrics** – Measuring performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.  
**Comparison of Models** – Assessing model strengths and selecting the most effective churn predictor.  


## Methodology
• **Feature Selection** – Removed irrelevant columns and selected features based on statistical significance.  
• **Data Transformation** – Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features (Geography, Gender).  
• **Model Training** – Implemented **Logistic Regression, SVM, DNN, and CNN** for classification.  
• **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimized models using **GridSearchCV** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.  
• **Evaluation** – Compared models based on **recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves**.
